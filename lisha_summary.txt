After reading the article, I learned the AI can be able to integrate in the learning of wildlife, and that dramatically increase the speed for scientists to understand the wildlife population. The AI help to identifying animals from photos and categorizing many millions of camera trap photos. I am surprised that a lot of camera trap photos can be identify by machine and the result might be more accurate than human. The question that bring up to me is how can human to improve the accuracy of the computer to the extent that is more accurate than human. Also, what are the difference between machine learning and AI.
