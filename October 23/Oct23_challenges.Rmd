Note: The following notebook is adapted from an exercise by Tina Cormier (Woods Hole Research Center) and Ned Horning (American Museum of Natural History)

Read the iris.csv file into R using the read.csv function and assign the file to a variable of your choice.
```{r}

```


How many rows and columns does the table have?

```{r}

```


What are the column names?

```{r}

```

What value is located in row 49, column 5? 

```{r}

```

Note: In the following questions, you may have to use the '$' operator to select the columns that you would like to index.

What is the range of values (min - max) of the column "Petal.Length"? 

```{r}

```

What is the mean Sepal.Length?

```{r}

```


Make a plot of Sepal Length vs. Petal Length

```{r}

```

Add a column to your "iris" data frame, and name it "cut".

```{r}

```


EXTRA CREDIT: For every record, if the Petal.Length is greater than 3, populate the "cut" field with the word "yes." For all other values of Petal.Length, "cut" should have the value "no".

```{r}

```


EXTRA EXTRA CREDIT: Add another columne to the "iris" data frame, and name it "index."  Values in this column should range from 1 - number of rows. 

```{r}

```

SUPER EXTRA CREDIT CHALLENGE: 
Next, for every record in the "iris" data frame, print the sentence "Plant [value in Index column] is an iris [value in the Species column]." 
Hint: use a loop with a print/paste statement.

```{r}

```
