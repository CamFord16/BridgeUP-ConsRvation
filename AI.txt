\f0\fs24 \cf0 Artificial Intelligence \
\
	I learned that AI is a software that can analyze animal photos and videos. A programmed bot that can do human work faster and easier than the researcher himself. It makes people\'92s work easier and it can help with animal counting. It can determine the animal species, and determine if this animal is needed protection. Also there are machines that can learn tasks on their own. It\'92s a complex computer algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. \
	Things that surprised me is that giraffe species reduced by more than 70%, and that artificial intelligence (AI) powers Amazon's Alexa, Gmail's spam filter, and Facebook's new friends suggestions. Also that AI working on self-driving cars. It did surprise me because I remember that I read an article about self-driving cars. \
	While reading about how Wildbook program can help to a work in conservation that can identify animal  by their unique wool patterns or other distinctive features. Right away it made me think about NDVI. Maybe it may be possible to create a program that works on the same principle. \
	I don\'92t know for sure if such a program already exists, but I\'92m wondering if there is a face recognition program. Identify a person on the principle that Wildbook works.\
