Date: HALLOWEEN >:)
Today was pajama day at school so I’m currently wearing pajamas. I forgot what I was wearing when I left school so I didn’t know why I was receiving weird looks on the street, but then I realized it was because of my pajamas. But I still felt comfortable in my pajamas. 
As it got darker I started to see more and more people in costumes.
