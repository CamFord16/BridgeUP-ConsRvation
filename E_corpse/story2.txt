Grieck Yoghert was a young boy who lived with his 17 siblings, herding penguins in the Arctic Circle.
One fine morning, when Grieck went to check on his penguins, he saw a rebellious penguin fraternizing with a polar bear on the edge of the fence.

A day later, Grieck was taking a stroll through the Arctic when suddenly, he came across an exquisite corpse! It was the polar bear and penguin, attached together by a humongous cockroach.
